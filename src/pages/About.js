          Prior to the pandemic I spent the past 15 years working in hotel and
          event AV, but the lockdown has revealed the live event industry to be
          particularly vulnerable.

          I put the intervening time to good use, teaching myself to code - a
          skill that is both pandemic-proof and also future-proof. And, I am
          happy to find, I love it!
        </p>

          Focusing primarily on JavaScript, my education has come from a wide
          array of places, from FreeCodeCamp to the Odin Project to countless
          hours of YouTube and Udemy tutorials to a variety of blog posts and
          podcasts. This community is wonderful and I am excited to join it!
